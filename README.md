# CRTsentiment
In this notebook, I've analyzed the sentiments of ttweets tagged #criticalracetheory. This project was inspired by work I did at Public Relations firm. Our client, an educational organization, wanted us to check twitter daily for high-profile tweets discussing critical race theory. Theye essentially wanted to gauge the general mood of the conversation. Later as I began learning how to analyze data with python, it occurred to me that sentiment analysis could have several applications in the public relations field, particularly as a more savvy way to track social media discussions.
