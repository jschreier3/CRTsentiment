# CRTsentiment
This project was inspired by work I did at Public Relations firm. Our client, an educational organization, wanted us to check twitter daily for high-profile tweets discussing critical race theory to gauge the general mood of the conversation as a measure of controversy.

Later as I began learning how to analyze data with python, it occurred to me that sentiment analysis could have several applications in the public relations field, particularly as a more savvy way to track social media discussions.

In this notebook, I've analyzed the sentiments of tweets tagged #criticalracetheory using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sentiment Reasoner), and RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pre-training) to score the sentiment of each tweet to synthesize in a report of the general 'mood' of twitter on #criticalracetheory on a given day.

The tweets were gathered using [trackmyhashtag.com](https://www.trackmyhashtag.com/)https://www.trackmyhashtag.com/
