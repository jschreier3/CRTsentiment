# CRTsentiment
This project was inspired by work I did at Public Relations firm, our client, an educational organization, wanted us to check twitter daily for high-profile tweets discussing critical race theory. They essentially wanted to gauge the general mood of the conversation. Later as I began learning how to analyze data with python, it occurred to me that sentiment analysis could have several applications in the public relations field, particularly as a more savvy way to track social media discussions.

In this notebook, I've analyzed the sentiments of tweets tagged #criticalracetheory. 


The tweets were gathered using [trackmyhashtag.com](https://www.trackmyhashtag.com/)https://www.trackmyhashtag.com/
